This is Ajinkya Deshpande's home on the web!

I am a pre-doctoral researcher (Research fellow) at Microsoft Research Lab India. I am interested in topics like Graph Representation Learning, Node Classification and Spectral Methods, and applications to diverse domains like Multi-Behaviour recommendation, Code Generation and Quantum Computing. I received the Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science Degree, along with a Minor in Physics from BITS Pilani in 2021. Most recently, our conference paper on graph unsupervised representation learning under heterophily, for which I was first author, was accepted at NeurIPS â€™23.
